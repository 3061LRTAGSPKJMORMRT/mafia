        <p>
            This Privacy Policy was updated on April 27, 2024.
            <br>
            This Privacy Policy will take effect on May 1, 2024.
            <br><br>
            This privacy policy below is only applicable to Mafia Remastered. In this privacy policy, 
            any time the word <i>we</i> or <i>us</i> is used, it is referred to Mafia Remastered. 
            <br><br>
            Any time we mention the word <i>game</i>, it is referred to a simulation of a game that 
            is played on Discord, and not any third-party game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Mafia Remastered is a discord bot application designed to allow discord users to play Mafia 
            on Discord! Players can join using the /join command, or click a button to join a game and play. 
            When you play Mafia Remastered, the game logs your user id and info to give you awards for achievements 
            or rewards. 
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered is comitted in ensuring that your data is protected. Mafia Remastered adheres to laws
            related to data protection to ensure a smooth experience when you use Mafia Remastered.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Information Collected</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our bot for the first time, you give consent for Mafia Remastered to store your data for 
            various purposes. The data we collect is your Discord user ID that is used as a way to identify between 
            different users. We also store all prompts you submit through Mafia Remastered, through modals and commands,
            that includes, but is not limited to, <i>Last Will Customization</i>, <i>Custom Mafia Death Message</i> and 
            <i>Last Wills</i>.
            <br><br>
            For <i>Last Wills</i> and other game related data, they will be only stored until the game ends, which at most, 
            lasts 5 hours. Game related data includes your action towards other users on Discord, your current status on the 
            game, and the role that has been generated to you.
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered also stores game logs that includes the user's Discord username, for 5 days before deleting the 
            logs to respect user privacy. After a new game has ended, the button to view the game logs will show the logs 
            for the latest game instead. The game log feature can be turned off by Server Administrators at any time for 
            their Discord Server.
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered also stores your Authorization token when you authorize with the bot through the <i>/connect</i> 
            slash command. Alongside with this, your refresh token is stored as well to ensure that the bot is able to 
            generate a new authorization token using the refresh token. The only way we collect this is by you running the 
            command mentioned above, and clicking on the button, and authorizing with the bot.
            <br><br>
            For users that wish to subscribe to the premium version of Mafia Remastered, we do not collect anything, besides your 
            Discord User ID. However, your email and payment information are sent to Stripe. For more information on how Stripe 
            collects your data, you may visit <a href="https://stripe.com/en-my/legal/privacy-center">https://stripe.com/en-my/legal/privacy-center</a>. 
            We only collect your email, only IF you make a payment to Stripe, to subscribe to Mafia Remastered's premium plan.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
            Your Discord user ID is stored to distinguish you and other players when displaying your statistics. 
            These statistics includes achievements, current balance (fake currency), win statistics and role statistics. 
            Your statistics can be viewed by other people using Mafia Remastered.
            <br><br>
            Your info sent through modals and commands are used for game purposes. Your last will is shown when you die 
            in the game, and your custom mafia death message is shown when you die to the mafia in the game. Your last 
            will customization is used to display a more vibrant embed once you die, acting like a template.
            <br><br>
            Your Discord Username is stored in game logs, if the feature is enabled by Server Administrators. Any buttons 
            and select menus you clicked during the game is also stored to ensure that you are not away from keyboard (AFK), 
            and to show in the game logs about your actions. 
            <br><br>
            Your Authorization token and Refresh token is stored with us for the only purpose of putting you into group DMs. 
            We only collect this information once you authorize with Mafia Remastered that can be achieved through the 
            <i>/connect</i> slash command.
            <br><br>
            Your email and payment information collected by Stripe is there to ensure that the payment process is smooth. Your payment 
            information stays hidden to us, so Mafia Remastered has no options to look at your payment information. We can only access the 
            email you used for subscribing to our plan, as a way to verify details should you request additional support. We do not reveal these 
            email unless we can specifically confirm that the email in discussion is yours.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            As stated above, we collect your Discord user ID, your Discord username, the prompts you enter when using 
            Mafia Remastered and the buttons or select menus you click. Some of your data will be deleted after a certain 
            amount of time, depending on the use case and the activity of the Discord server. 
            <br><br>
            Your Discord user ID is retained as long as you have used the bot once, and share at least 1 common Discord 
            server with Mafia Remastered. If you leave all servers and don't share any common Discord servers, all of your 
            data will be removed from us after one (1) week of you leaving from the last common Discord server shared between 
            you.
            <br><br>
            Your Discord username and your actions (clicking a button or using the select menu) 
            is retained until the game logs is refreshed, or after five (5) days. Alternatively, if the Discord server 
            decides to disable the game log feature, your username will no longer be stored with us.
            <br><br>
            The items you buy from the shop that uses Mafia Remastered's (fake) economy, is tied with your Discord user ID,
            which is retained until your we no longer store you Discord user ID. This is also the case for game punishments 
            and your authorization token as well as your refresh token.
            <br><br>
            Your authorization token and refresh token is given to us by Discord and is only valid until you de-authorize it. 
            You may do so by going to your Discord profile, go to settings and disconnect from Mafia Remastered from 
            <i>Authorized Apps</i>. This can be done through the Discord web client, the Discord mobile app or the desktop app.
            <br><br>
            You can request to delete all your data from Mafia Remastered. By doing so, any data you previously had will be 
            completely wiped, with no backup or traces from us. After requesting, the data will be wiped after 7 days. 
            Should you wish to cancel your action, you may do it within the 7 days, before your data gets wiped. To request 
            for data deletion, you may join Mafia Remastered's official Discord support server and request for support. 
            <br><br>
            Regarding saved payments, to delete your details, please visit the Stripe website, as your payment information is not 
            stored with us. However, you may still request to delete your subscription history with us. Doing this will make you ineligible 
            to request any refunds or support regarding certain payments.
        </p>

            Discord user ID. Only the developers of Mafia Remastered have full access to your data. Mafia Remastered does 
            not collect any other personal or sensitive data.

            to other players in the game. Discord themselves also warn you that you should not enter sensitive information 
            in the modals. We will not be held responsible if you decide to reveal your information to us, and that 
            information is displayed to everyone else. 
            <br><br>
            All payment information that you enter is not handled by us, but by Stripe. As mentioned above, you may view 
            Stripe's privacy policy to see how they secure your data.
