        <h2>Information Collected</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our bot for the first time, you give consent for Mafia Remastered to store your data for 
            various purposes. The data we collect is your Discord user ID that is used as a way to identify between 
            different users. We also store all prompts you submit through Mafia Remastered, through modals and commands,
            that includes, but is not limited to, <i>Last Will Customization</i>, <i>Custom Mafia Death Message</i> and 
            <i>Last Wills</i>.
            <br><br>
            For <i>Last Wills</i> and other game related data, they will be only stored until the game ends, which at most, 
            lasts 5 hours. Game related data includes your action towards other users on Discord, your current status on the 
            game, and the role that has been generated to you.
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered also stores game logs that includes the user's Discord username, for 5 days before deleting the 
            logs to respect user privacy. After a new game has ended, the button to view the game logs will show the logs 
            for the latest game instead. The game log feature can be turned off by Server Administrators at any time for 
            their Discord Server.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
            Your Discord user ID is stored to distinguish you and other players when displaying your statistics. 
            These statistics includes achievements, current balance (fake currency), win statistics and role statistics. 
            Your statistics can be viewed by other people using Mafia Remastered.
            <br>
            Your info sent through modals and commands are used for game purposes. Your last will is shown when you die 
            in the game, and your custom mafia death message is shown when you die to the mafia in the game. Your last 
            will customization is used to display a more vibrant embed once you die, acting like a template.
            <br>
            Your Discord Username is stored in game logs, if the feature is enabled by Server Administrators. Any buttons 
            and select menus you clicked during the game is also stored to ensure that you are not AFK, and to show in the 
            game logs about your actions. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            As stated above, we collect your Discord user ID, your Discord username, the prompts you enter when using 
            Mafia Remastered and the buttons or select menus you click. You can always request to remove your data 
            at any given time by joining the support server. Everything related to your data will be wiped.
