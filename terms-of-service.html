        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
            This Terms of Service was updated on February 15, 2024.
            <br><br>
            The terms of service below is only applicable to Mafia Remastered. In this Terms of Service, 
            any time the word <i>we</i> or <i>us</i> is used, it is referred to Mafia Remastered. 
            <br><br>
            Any time we mention the word <i>game</i>, it is referred to a simulation of a game that 
            is played on Discord, and not any third-party game.
            <br><br>
            As we further explain the Terms of Service, we will use the abbreviation <i>ToS</i>, 
            that refers to Mafia Remastered's Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Mafia Remastered is a discord bot application designed to allow discord users to play Mafia 
            on Discord! Players can join using the /join command, or click a button to join a game and play. 
            When you play Mafia Remastered, the game logs your user id and info to give you awards for achievements 
            or rewards. 
            <br><br>
            By using Mafia Remastered, you agree to comply with the ToS listed here. At any point, if you disagree 
            with our ToS, you are not allowed to use the service that we provide.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Use of Mafia Remastered</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our bot for the first time, you give consent for Mafia Remastered to store your data for 
            various purposes. For all the details regarding your privacy, you may visit our privacy policy page at
            <a href="https://3061lrtagspkjmormrt.github.io/mafia/privacy-policy">
                https://3061lrtagspkjmormrt.github.io/mafia/privacy-policy
            </a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
            When using Mafia Remastered, the information that you might receive when playing the game might be 
            inaccurate. While there may be a number of game roles that do this, we are not liable if 
            Mafia Remastered shows inaccurate information. If this happens, you can report the bug you 
            experienced in the support server. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Should you lose the game because of this bug, we reserve the right to not compensate you even if it 
            results in a loss outside of the scope of Mafia Remastered. Mafia Remastered tries to ensure that the 
            information it gives is accurate, however we cannot guarantee that as there may be other factors involved. 
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Discord's Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
            Mafia Remastered is in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service. Therefore, if we see a user or a player 
            breaking Discord's Terms of Service, we reserve the right to block your access to our services right away 
            as well as reporting your actions to Discord.
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered has zero tolerancy regarding users that break Discord's Terms of Service. Therefore, any 
            user or player is prohibited from using Mafia Remastered in any way that violates Discord's Terms of Service. 
            Mafia Remastered is not responsible if you are caught breaking Discord's Terms of Service while using 
            our services. 
        </p>

        <h3>Bot's Uptime</h3>
        <p>
            We try to ensure that Mafia Remastered stays online as much as it can, however there can be many 
            instances where we might fail to achieve so. Bot maintenance is often needed to fix the bugs so that the 
            end user or player has minimal impact while playing the game. In any scenario, we are not held liable if 
            you or your server is unable to play Mafia Remastered at a certain time. 
            <br><br>
            To prevent this issue, you may discuss with the developer to prevent this scenario from happening in 
            the future.
        </p>
        
        <br><br>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
            Mafia Remastered reserves the right to terminate and delete your data that we store at any time 
            without notice, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including the ToS listed here.
            <br><br>
            As a suspended user, trying to use the bot under an alternate account is a breach of these ToS, and this 
            may lead us to suspended and/or terminate access to all of your access to our services, which includes 
            being banned from Mafia Remastered's support server.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>

            and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, 
            damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses 
            (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of your use and access 
            of the Service, or a breach of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to the Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>
            This ToS mentions when it has been updated, which is at the top. Should the ToS of Mafia Remastered change 
            at any given time, it will be notified in the official Discord server. Alternatively, Mafia Remastered 
            also displays changes to their ToS through the patch update. Users can use the <i>/patch</i> slash command 
            to see info for any bot updates, privacy policy changes or terms of service changes.
            <br><br>
            Mafia Remastered also reserves the right to change the ToS at any given time, based solely on our own 
            discretion. Mafia Remastered will show a disclaimer if the ToS will be changing soon, to allow users 
            to read through before continuing. 
        </p>
